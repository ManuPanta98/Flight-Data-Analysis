## Flight Analysis: Pioneering Sustainable Aviation with FlightAnalysis 
In an era where the airline industry is at a pivotal crossroads, balancing with environmental concerns and the relentless demand for efficient, reliable service, a groundbreaking toolkit emerges: FlghtAnalysis. Developed by a visionary team from the Advanced Programming for Data Science course at NOVA School of Business and Economics, FlightAnalysis is not merely a software solutionâ€”it's the catalyst for a new age in aviation.


## Visuals
Herein below are some visual representation generated by the methods employed in this project. These visualization offer insigths of airline operations which can be used for route optimization fo a more sustainable enviroment.

 1. Map of the Airports in a Country:

This image presents a cartographic depiction of airports scattered across Italy, delivering a spatial perspective on how the nation's air travel framework is organized. Such a view helps in comprehending the layout and reach of Italy's aviation network.

 2. Distribution of Flight Distances

This histogram shows the distribution of flight distances for all flights. By understanding these patterns, FlightAnalysis can pinpoint opportunities for optimizing routes, thereby reducing fuel consumption and minimizing carbon emissions.

 3. Flight Routes from an Airport:

The visuals display all the flight routes departing from JFK Airport. The first  shows all the flights from the airport. The second one shows only domestic flights.

 4. Most Used Airplane Models by Number of Routes:

The visual depicts the 5 top most used airplane models based on the number of routes.

 5. Flight Routes from a Country

The visual shows the flights flight routes originating from Germany. As in the 3rd method, the first image consider all the flights while the second one only the ones internally.
