## Skyward Harmony: Pioneering Sustainable Aviation with FlightAnalysis 
In an era where the airline industry is at a pivotal crossroads, balancing with environmental concerns and the relentless demand for efficient, reliable service, a groundbreaking toolkit emerges: FlghtAnalysis. Developed by a visionary team from the Advanced Programming for Data Science course at NOVA School of Business and Economics, FlightAnalysis is not merely a software solutionâ€”it's the catalyst for a new age in aviation.


## Visuals
Herein below are some visual representation generated by the methods employed in this project. These visualization offer insigths of airline operations which can be used for route optimization fo a more sustainable enviroment.

## 1. Map of the Airports in a Country:

This image presents a cartographic depiction of airports scattered across Italy, delivering a spatial perspective on how the nation's air travel framework is organized. Such a view helps in comprehending the layout and reach of Italy's aviation network.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
